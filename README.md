DATABASE SYSTEMS--BMS

The Banquet Management System (BMS) is a system which allows
administrators to organise banquets, and users to login and register for
banquets. It provides SQL functions for administrator to manage and create
banquets. Finally, it provides search and reports for administrator as reference.
Users can also modify their registered data according to their needs.
